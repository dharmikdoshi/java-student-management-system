# Student Management System (Core Java Project)

==> About the Project
This project is a simple console-based Student Management System built only using Core Java.

The idea behind this project was to understand how Java works internally and how object-oriented concepts like classes, objects, inheritance, and encapsulation are used in a real program.

The application runs completely in the console and does not use any database or external libraries as of now, the same can be later added as enhancements.


## What the Application Can Do
Using this system, a user can:
- Add students
- Add courses
- Enroll students into courses
- View all students
- View all courses
- View all enrollments

All the data is stored temporarily in memory and is available only while the program is running.


## Tools and Technologies Used
- Java 21 (LTS)
- VS Code
- Core Java only (no frameworks, no database)

## Project Structure
The project is divided into packages to keep the code clean and organised:

com.airtribe.studentmanagement
├── Main.java
├── entity
│ ├── Person.java
│ ├── Student.java
│ ├── Course.java
│ └── Enrollment.java
└── service
├── StudentService.java
├── CourseService.java
└── EnrollmentService.java

## How to Run the Project
1. Java 21 installation required.
2. Open in VS Code or any other code editor.
3. Run the `Main.java` file.
4. Follow the menu options shown in the console.
